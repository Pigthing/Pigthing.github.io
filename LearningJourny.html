        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why are learning skills important?</strong></li>
            <p>Learning skills are essential for personal and professional growth. They make people adapt to new challenges, enhance problem-solving skills, and help people grow</p>
            <li><strong>Did your learning skills improve over the course of the semester? Explain.</strong></li>
            <p>Reflecting on the semester, I can confidently say that my learning skills have improved. Through dedicated effort and practice of my goals, I have to solve problems, and learn independently.</p>
        </ul>

    <h2>Course Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>As you look at the work in your Portfolio, what stands out as being your best and most successful work and why?</strong></li>
        <p>My sitcom project is the most notable item in my portfolio. It is especially remarkable because it was completely created, developed, and produced in less than three weeks. The quick turnaround not only reflects my commitment and work ethic, but it also shows that I can efficiently manage my time, stick to deadlines, and produce an excellent creative result in a limited amount of time.</p>
        <li><strong>In what areas could you improve and how?</strong></li>
        <p>My organising skills are one area where I see room for growth in the future. Even though I finished the sitcom assignment quickly and successfully, I know that I could be more productive overall if I were better organised. My goal is to improve my organisational abilities so that I can simplify processes and guarantee future project deadlines go more efficiently.</p>
        <li><strong>What did you learn that was most surprising or eye-opening about design or the process of design (design brief, research, brainstorming, idea generation, revisions, finalization, critique/reflection)?</strong></li>
        <p>My ability to pick up new technology fast was one of the course's most rewarding and unexpected takeaways. Accepting new hardware and software was crucial to completing a number of projects successfully. I discovered that my ability to quickly adapt and take in new technology really helped to the success of my projects, whether it was using design software to master it or investigating cutting-edge technologies to boost the creative process.</p>
        <li><strong>Now, looking at your answers to the above questions AND continuing to look at your designs, write a short text (about 3-5 sentences) to promote your strengths such as I’m a hard worker, I’m reliable, I have creative ideas, I take good photographs, I’m a good artist, etc.</strong></li>
        <p>My ability to combine originality, steadfast work, and continuously producing exceptional designs is what makes me successful. I take a lot of pride in thinking creatively, presenting original concepts, and converting them into eye-catching designs. I've successfully finished assignments with efficiency and attention to detail by pure determination and hard labour. The positive feedback I've gotten about my designs serve as a reminder of my dedication to quality work and a source of inspiration for producing great pictures.</p>
