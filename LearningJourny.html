        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why are learning skills important?</strong></li>
            <p>Learning skills are essential for personal and professional growth. They make people adapt to new challenges, enhance problem-solving skills, and help people grow</p>
            <li><strong>Did your learning skills improve over the course of the semester? Explain.</strong></li>
            <p>Reflecting on the semester, I can confidently say that my learning skills have improved. Through dedicated effort and practice of my goals, I have to solve problems, and learn independently.</p>
